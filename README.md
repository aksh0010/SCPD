# SCPD
This program is made to detect similarities amongst two 'c' programs/Files.


The most important requirement for this project is to know about the ways plagiarism can take place. For example, a 
student can modify the code, but the requirement is to learn about different ways a student can modify code to make 
it their work. 

Secondly, knowledge of program similarities techniques such as follows (but not the only ones):
   1) Fingerprint based 
   2) String based
   3) Parameterized
   4) Structural behavior
   5) Semantic Approach
   6) The behavior of a program
