# SCPD
This program is made to detect similarities amongst two 'c' programs/Files.


The most important requirement for this project is to know about the ways plagiarism can take place. For example, a 
student can modify the code, but the requirement is to learn about different ways a student can modify code to make 
it their work. 

Secondly, knowledge of program similarities techniques such as follows (but not the only ones):
i. Fingerprint based 
ii. String based
iii. Parameterized
iv. Structural behavior
v. Semantic Approach
vi. The behavior of a program
