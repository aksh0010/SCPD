# SCPD- Source Code Plagiarism Detection 
This program is made to detect similarities amongst two 'c' programs/Files.


The most important requirement for this project is to know about the ways plagiarism can take place. For example, a 
student can modify the code, but the requirement is to learn about different ways a student can modify code to make 
it their work. 

Such level could be as below 
   1) Level 1 : Changes to comments and indentation.
   2) Level 2 : Changes to identifiers.
   3) Level 3 : Changes in declarations (e.g. declaring extra constants,changing the order of functions and variables).
   4) Level 4 :Modifying functions (e.g. modifying signature, merging and creating new functions).
   5) Level 5 :Changing program statements to semantic equivalents(e.g. for to while, if to switch).
   6) Level 6 :Changes in decision logic and modifying expressions.

Secondly, knowledge of program similarities techniques such as follows (but not the only ones):
   1) Fingerprint based 
   2) String based
   3) Parameterized
   4) Structural behavior
   5) Semantic Approach
   6) The behavior of a program
